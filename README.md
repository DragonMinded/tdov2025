TDOV
====

A dummy simple scroller for the SEGA Naomi that displays a trans flag and a message for TDOV 2025. This is completely unoptimized and probably a bad example of how to do such a thing. Whatever. Ideally this would use the TA and hardware rendering for the font which would speed up rendering significantly. Run this on your Naomi by netbooting `tdov2025.bin` out of the `release/` directory.
